## 🐞 Playwright Test report 

Test report URL for the latest run in CI is available in the run itself and here: https://microsoft.github.io/playwright-examples/

> [!NOTE]
> - For the above report to be available, as a one time measure, a project admin or maintainer has to manually enable `Pages` settings to use `GithHub Actions` as a source for `Build and Deployment`. 
> - The detailed steps are mentioned in github official docs [here: Required steps are from step 1 till 4. Step 5 is to be skipped, since we already have workflow in our repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#publishing-with-a-custom-github-actions-workflow).
